{"question_id":5,"text":"Sure. Quantum computing is a new technology that uses quantum mechanical phenomena to perform operations on data. Unlike traditional computers, which process information in binary form, quantum computers can process information in multiple states at the same time, allowing them to perform operations faster and with more accuracy. It also allows them to solve problems that classical computers struggle with. Quantum computing is still in its infancy, but it has the potential to revolutionize the computing industry and open up new possibilities in artificial intelligence, cryptography, and other fields.","answer_id":"UrLEH82RHwqqLt2LyvYSKj","model_id":"alpaca-13b:v1","metadata":{"huggingface_argument":{"do_sample":true,"temperature":0.7,"max_new_tokens":1024}}}

{"question_id":47,"text":"On average, about 100 snowflakes fall per second during a typical winter. This number can vary drastically depending on the location and severity of the storm. Snowflakes are made up of tiny ice crystals, which form in the atmosphere when the temperature is below freezing and there is moisture in the air. As air moves and mixes, the crystals come together to form snowflakes. The shape, size and number of snowflakes depend on the atmospheric conditions, such as temperature and humidity, when they form.","answer_id":"KSePbzLwsYasR3aui4HU8h","model_id":"alpaca-13b:v1","metadata":{"huggingface_argument":{"do_sample":true,"temperature":0.7,"max_new_tokens":1024}}}

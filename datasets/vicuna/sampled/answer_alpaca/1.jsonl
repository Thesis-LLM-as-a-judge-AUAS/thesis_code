{"question_id":57,"text":"If the Suez Canal had never been constructed, it would have major implications for international trade and navigation. The Suez Canal is an important shipping route connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea, which in turn connects to the Indian Ocean. This allows for a shorter and more direct route for ships traveling between Europe and Asia, reducing travel time significantly. Without the Suez Canal, ships would have to travel around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa, which is much more time consuming and costly. This would make international trade more difficult and expensive, and could hinder global economic growth.","answer_id":"EiNn9jjfy7dga6xfCtLtF8","model_id":"alpaca-13b:v1","metadata":{"huggingface_argument":{"do_sample":true,"temperature":0.7,"max_new_tokens":1024}}}

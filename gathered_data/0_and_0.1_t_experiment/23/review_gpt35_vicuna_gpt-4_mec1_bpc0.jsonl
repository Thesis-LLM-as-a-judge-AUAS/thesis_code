Assistant 1's program is more accurate because it reads and counts the occurrences of the specific word, not the line that contains the word. It also converts the text to lowercase to ensure the search is case-insensitive, which is a common requirement in such tasks. Assistant 1 also provided a detailed explanation of how the code works, which is very helpful for someone learning to program.

Assistant 2 provided a bit more detail by mentioning the typical threshold for herd immunity (90-95%) and emphasizing the importance of vaccinations for the community as a whole. \nScore of the Assistant 1: 9\nScore of the Assistant 2: 10"], "review_bpc": [], "cost": 0.029369999999999997, "score": [9.0, 10.0]}

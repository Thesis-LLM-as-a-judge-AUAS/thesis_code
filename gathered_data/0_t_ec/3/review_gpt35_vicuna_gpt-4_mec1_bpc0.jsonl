Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.", "review": ["Evaluation evidence: Assistant 1 provided a detailed and step-by-step explanation of how to estimate the number of text messages sent globally in a minute. The assistant used a specific statistic and then broke it down into an hourly rate, and then a minute rate. The assistant also acknowledged that this is an estimate and may vary due to various factors. This response was helpful, relevant, accurate, and detailed. On the other hand, Assistant 2 did not provide a specific answer or estimate. Instead, the assistant explained why it is difficult to determine the exact number of text messages sent globally in a minute. While this response is accurate and provides some detail, it is less helpful and relevant because it does not attempt to answer the question with an estimate, as Assistant 1 did.\nScore of the Assistant 1: 9\nScore of the Assistant 2: 6"], "review_bpc": [], "cost": 0.03018, "score": [9.0, 6.0]}

The code is well-structured and the assistant also explained how each method works. Additionally, the assistant provided an example of how to use the implemented class, which is very helpful for understanding. On the other hand, Assistant 2's response is incorrect. The assistant provided a Python code but mistakenly labeled it as C++ code. Moreover, the logic of the queue implementation is incorrect. The enqueue method clears the out_stack every time it is called, which is not the correct behavior of a queue. The dequeue method also does not correctly mimic the behavior of a queue.

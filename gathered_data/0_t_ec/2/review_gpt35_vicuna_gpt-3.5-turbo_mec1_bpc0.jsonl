They broke down the process step by step, starting from the formation of lightning in thunderstorms to calculating the average number of lightning strikes per day based on thunderstorm frequency and the percentage of thunderstorms that produce lightning. The assistant also acknowledged the variability in estimates from different sources. However, there was a slight discrepancy in the final estimated number of lightning strikes per day mentioned in the explanation.\n\nAssistant 2, on the other hand, gave a more general explanation without delving into specific calculations or sources of data. The assistant mentioned some key factors influencing the number of lightning strikes per day, such as weather conditions, time of year, and geographical location. While the assistant provided an estimate of 100,000,000 lightning strikes per day, they did not provide a detailed breakdown of how they arrived at this number or reference specific studies or sources.\n\nOverall, Assistant 1's response was more informative, detailed, and structured compared to Assistant 2, as it provided a step-by-step calculation process and acknowledged the variability in estimates.

They both explained the factors that make it difficult to pinpoint an exact number, such as the size & shape of snowflakes and the weather conditions.

This indicates an adequate understanding and level of detail in their explanations. However, Assistant 1 provided a more precise approach by including a specific statistic from NOAA to give a context for the scope of snowfall. On the other hand, Assistant 2, while also providing a fine step-by-step analysis, used an estimation of \"67 inches\" for average snowfall, which is significantly higher than NOAA's report and may lead to misinformation.

They both have explained the importance of Turing's effort in cracking the Enigma code, and how different the outcome might have been if he had not cracked it. Assistant 1 has included a valuable addition by mentioning that Turing's work on the Enigma code laid the foundation for modern computing and artificial intelligence. This relevant information gives a separate dimension to Turing's contribution, beyond the WWII context. Assistant 2 added a useful perspective about how the Allies might have to develop other strategies to win the battle.

This additional information gave a broader view on the impact of Turing's work beyond the scope of WWII. Assistant 2, while also giving a satisfactory answer, missed this point. Therefore, I believe Assistant 1 deserves a slightly higher score.\nScore of the Assistant 1: 10\nScore of the Assistant 2: 9","Evaluation Evidence: \n\nBoth AI assistants provided relevant and accurate responses to the question. They both started by explaining the impact of Turing's work on WWII and how the war might have turned out differently had he not cracked the Enigma code. Moreover, both assistants pointed out that the lack of Turing's contributions could have possibly extended the length of the war and changed the outcome of the key battles. Assistant 1 and Assistant 2 also introduced the complexity of the Enigma code and how its decryption played a crucial role in the Allied victory.\n\nWhere Assistant 1 distinguishes itself is the explanation of how Turing's work on the Enigma code impacted the later developments in the field of computing and artificial intelligence. This additional information provided a wider context for Turing's work and its significance and offered more valuable insight in response to the question. \n\nAssistant 2, on the other side, added the possibility of how Allies might have developed alternative strategies to decipher German plans.

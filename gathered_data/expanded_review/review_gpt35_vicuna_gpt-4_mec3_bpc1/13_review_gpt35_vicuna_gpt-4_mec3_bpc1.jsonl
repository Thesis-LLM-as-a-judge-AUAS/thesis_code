They complete the user request by explaining the complexity of determining an exact number, and they do a good job explaining how factors such as location, temperature and humidity can affect snowfall. Both assistants stress that estimates can only be made, due to the variation in size and shape of snowflakes and the amount of snowfall that typically occurs. However, Assistant 1 does a slightly better job by providing specific data from a reliable source (NOAA), while Assistant 2 makes a little mistake by stating that the average snowfall for a typical winter is 67 inches, which is too high for most places, even with the heaviest snowfall.

However, Assistant 1 was a bit more concise, stating that snowfall is typically measured in inches rather than the number of snowflakes, and linking this to the average snowfall data from NOAA.

Assistant 1 utilized information from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to explain average snowfall in the U.S., while Assistant 2 gave a general snowfall figure with less sourcing, but went into greater detail about how snowflakes form, their average size, cloud characteristics, and the rate of fall to the ground. \n\nScore of the Assistant 1: 9\nScore of the Assistant 2: 10","Evaluation evidence: Both Assistant 1 and Assistant 2 provided a comprehensive answer to the relatively complex question about the number of snowflakes in a typical winter.

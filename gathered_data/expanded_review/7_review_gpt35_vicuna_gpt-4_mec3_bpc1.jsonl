Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.","review":["Evaluation evidence: Both Assistant 1 and Assistant 2 started by notifying that it's impossible to determine the exact number of snowflakes falling in a winter due to factors such as location, temperature, and weather patterns. They both tried to explain a hypothetical calculation to derive an estimate. Assistant 1 used the average snowfall in the United States (28 inches\/year according to NOAA) and the number of flakes in an inch of snow to determine an estimate. Although this still remained pretty vague, it was a more reasonable approach than Assistant 2 who muddled the explanation with details like the size of a snowflake, cloud density, falling speed, and the formation of larger snow clumps, etc. That created a good lesson about snow but didn't answer the question as well as Assistant 1.\nScore of the Assistant 1: 9\nScore of the Assistant 2: 7","Evaluation evidence: Both assistants provide relatively clear estimations on the number of snowflakes that fall during a typical winter, walking the user through the various factors affecting the quantity of snowflakes. Assistant 1 provides a generally clear explanation, using the average annual snowfall in the United States from NOAA as a baseline for estimation. However, Assistant 1 does not go further in elaboration, merely concluding that the number must be in the millions, if not billions. Assistant 2, on the other hand, while offering the same basic analysis, goes a step further and offers more information about the formation of snowflakes and weather patterns, providing more context and detail to the user.

Assistant 1 cut right to the chase and shared an approach to estimate the number using the NOAA's reported average snowfall and an approximate range of the number of snowflakes per inch. Apart from that, this assistant included conversations on the measurement of snowfall, sizes, and shapes of snowflakes, which makes his answer more detailed.

Assistant 1 provided a slightly more approachable explanation, focusing more on snowflake formation and typical methods of snowfall measurement, while also providing data from the NOAA on average yearly snowfall. Assistant 2, meanwhile, dove deeper into the formation of snowflakes and the conditions necessary for them to fall, and mentioned how different factors like wind speed and direction can affect how snowflakes fall.

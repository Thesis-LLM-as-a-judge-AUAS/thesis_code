On the other hand, Assistant 2's response directly attempted to calculate an approximate number based on daily global text message statistics, which can be seen as more helpful to the user's query.\n\n2. **Relevance**: Assistant 2's response was more relevant to the user's question as it directly addressed the estimate of text messages sent globally in a minute. Assistant 1, however, while discussing the complexities in determining the exact number, did not provide a concrete estimate, thus making its response less relevant in addressing the user's query.\n\n3. **Accuracy**: Assistant 2's response provided a calculation to estimate the number of text messages sent globally in a minute based on daily statistics. While this calculation might not account for all variables and may have limitations, it still attempted to provide a quantifiable estimate. Assistant 1, on the other hand, did not offer any numerical estimate, thereby lacking accuracy in terms of directly addressing the estimated figure.\n\n4. **Level of Detail**: Assistant 2's response was detailed in terms of providing the daily text message statistic, converting it to hourly figures, and then further breaking it down to calculate text messages sent in a minute. This detail aids in understanding how the estimate was derived. In contrast, Assistant 1's response lacked detailed information on estimates or calculations, focusing more on the challenges of determining the exact number.\n\nConsidering the evaluation criteria above, Assistant 2 appears to have performed better in this scenario by providing a quantifiable estimate and relevant information compared to Assistant 1.\n\nEvaluation evidence: Assistant 1: 4\/10, Assistant 2: 8\/10.  \nScore of the Assistant 1: 4  \nScore of the Assistant 2: 8"],"cost":0.006252,"score":[4.0,8.0]}
